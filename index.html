  <p class="head">INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p>I am a Change Agent, Teacher, Volunteer, Project Manager, Quality Improvement Associate, Computer Scientist and a Physicist. A Learning Enthusiast with a deep passion and commitment to build and see Nigeria, and ultimately Africa at large, become a leading force; producing thought-provoking, mind-reorienting and environmental-changing knowledge based reforms using all and various available learning platforms.
    I also have the passion to seeing things, organizations and people operate at a Glocal level (that is, using local, native processes that can compete at global level). I am self-motivated, adaptable, creative, kaizen-driven, problem solving willed, change-driven, knowledge-driven, opportunity-driven, and people-centered.
    I have a logical mind with a practical approach to problem solving and a drive to see things through to completion. I have a great eye for detail. I am always eager to learn, I enjoy overcoming challenges, and I have a genuine interest in Business Management.
    I possess an ability to motivate others, coupled with the ability to communicate comfortably at all levels, therefore ensuring a working environment for all members of the team to perform at their best.
    I have a desire to see Nigerians and Africans empowered with knowledge and the know-hows of their abilities and capacities to reform the environment- individually and collectively, and to set them free from the chains of depending on what they are being subjected to by the environment. To empower them to be able to use what the society and environment has available to develop a suitable, enviable, adaptable and adoptable standard for every person. To change their mindset from INCAPABLE to I AM CAPABLE. To be a force to reckon with, a trailblazer, the standard and the trigger point of reformation. I believe in Accountability and Integrity.</p>
